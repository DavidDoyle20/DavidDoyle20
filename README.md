## Hi there 👋 I'm David Doyle

My goal in life is to perpetually improve and challenge myself everydat. I've been enjoying putting alot of my effort into learning as much as I can about software engineering.

I'm currently on the lookout for any role in software development but ideally backend developer. I'd especially love to on a tight knit team where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!
