## Hi there 👋 I'm David Doyle

My goal in life is to perpetually improve. I've been enjoying putting alot of my effort into learning as much as I can about software engineering.

I'm currently on the lookout for a role in backend development. Ideally writing Go or Python. I'd especially love to work at a startup on a tight knit team where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!

- 🖥️ I'm currently working on a habit progression app and a campus navigation app
- 🌱 I'm currently learning react and kubernetes
- 📫 How to reach me: Email me at ddoyle20@proton.me
